<br>
<b>To Make a Dadist Poem</b>
<br>
<i>By Tristan Tzara</i>
<br>
<br>
Take a newspaper.<br>
Take some scissors.<br>
Choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.<br>
Cut out the article.<br>
Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.<br>
Shake gently.<br>
Next take out each cutting one after the other.<br>
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.<br>
The poem will resemble you.<br>
And there you are--an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.<br> 
<br>

<b>Proclamation Without Pretension</b>
<br>
<i>By Tristan Tzara</i>
<br>
<br>
Art is going to sleep for a new world to be born<br>
"ART"-parrot word-replaced by DADA,<br>
PLESIOSAURUS, or handkerchief<br>
<br>
The talent THAT CAN BE LEARNED makes the<br>
poet a druggist TODAY the criticism<br>
of balances no longer challenges with resemblances<br>
<br>
Hypertrophic painters hyperaes-<br>
theticized and hypnotized by the hyacinths<br>
of the hypocritical-looking muezzins<br>
<br>
CONSOLIDATE THE HARVEST OF EX-<br>
ACT CALCULATIONS<br>
<br>
Hypodrome of immortal guarantees: there is<br>
no such thing as importance there is no transparence <br>
or appearance<br>
<br>
MUSICIANS SMASH YOUR INSTRUMENTS<br>
BLIND MEN take the stage<br>
<br>
THE SYRINGE is only for my understanding. I write because it is<br>
natural exactly the way I piss the way I'm sick<br>
<br>
ART NEEDS AN OPERATION<br>
<br>
Art is a PRETENSION warmed by the<br>
TIMIDITY of the urinary basin, the hysteria born<br>
in THE STUDIO<br>
<br>
We are in search of<br>
the force that is direct pure sober<br> 
UNIQUE we are in search of NOTHING<br>
we affirm the VITALITY of every IN-<br>
STANT<br>
<br>
the anti-philosophy of spontaneous acrobatics<br>
<br>
At this moment I hate the man who whispers<br>
before the intermission-eau de cologne-<br>
sour theatre. THE JOYOUS WIND<br>
<br>
If each man says the opposite it is because he is<br>
right<br>
<br>
Get ready for the action of the geyser of our blood <br>
-submarine formation of transchromatic aero-<br>
planes, cellular metals numbered in<br>
the flight of images<br>
<br>
above the rules of the<br>
and its control<br>
<br>
BEAUTIFUL<br>
<br>
It is not for the sawed-off imps<br>
who still worship their navel <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Vegetable Swallow</b>
<br>
<i>By Tristan Tzara</i>
<br>
<br>
two smiles meet towards<br>
the child-wheel of my zeal<br>
the bloody baggage of creatures<br>
made flesh in physical legends-lives<br>
<br>
the nimble stags storms cloud over<br>
rain falls under the scissors of<br>
the dark hairdresser-furiously<br>
swimming under the clashing arpeggios<br>
<br>
in the machine's sap grass<br>
grows around with sharp eyes<br>
here the share of our caresses<br>
dead and departed with the waves<br>
<br>
gives itself up to the judgment of time<br>
parted by the meridian of hairs<br>
non strikes in our hands<br>
the spices of human pleasures<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Great Lament Of My Obscurity Three</b>
<br>
<i>By Tristan Tzara</i>
<br>
<br>
where we live the flowers of the clocks catch fire and the plumes encircle the brightness in the distant sulphur morning the cows lick the salt lilies<br> 
my son<br>
my son<br>
let us always shuffle through the colour of the world<br>
which looks bluer than the subway and astronomy<br>
we are too thin<br>
we have no mouth<br>
our legs are stiff and knock together<br>
our faces are formeless like the stars<br>
crystal points without strength burned basilica<br>
mad : the zigzags crack<br>
telephone<br>
bite the rigging liquefy<br>
the arc<br>
climb<br>
astral<br>
memory<br>
towards the north through its double fruit<br>
like raw flesh<br>
hunger fire blood<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Cinema Calendar Of The Abstract Heart</b>
<br>
<i>By Tristan Tzara</i>
<br>
<br>
the fibres give in to your starry warmth<br>
a lamp is called green and sees<br>
carefully stepping into a season of fever<br>
the wind has swept the rivers' magic<br>
and i've perforated the nerve<br>
by the clear frozen lake<br>
has snapped the sabre<br>
but the dance round terrace tables<br>
shuts in the shock of the marble shudder<br>
new sober <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Dance of Death (Ball)</b>
<br>
<i>By Hugo Ball</i>
<br>
<br>
That’s how we die, that’s how we die,<br>
We die every day.<br>
Because it is so comfy to let go.<br>
Mornings still in sleep and dream,<br>
Noontime already there,<br>
By evening at the bottom of a grave.<br>
<br>
Slaughter is our house of joy.<br>
Blood is our only sun.<br>
Death is our sign, our magic word.<br>
We leave both wife and child,<br>
What have they to do with us?<br>
If one relies <br>
on us alone . . . <br>
<br>
So we murder, so we kill.<br>
We murder every day<br>
our comrades in a dance of death.<br>
Brother, figure it out with me –<br>
brother, your breast,<br>
brother you must fall and die.<br>
<br>
We don’t murmur, we don’t growl,<br> 
We’re quiet every day.<br>
Until the joint of the hip-bone turns.<br>
Our camping ground is hard.<br>
Our bread is dry.<br>
Bloody and soiled our dear god.<br>
<br>
We thank you, we thank you,<br>
Dear Kaiser, for your grace<br>
in deciding to lie down and die.<br>
Just sleep, sleep soft and still.<br>
Until you waken our poor body,<br> 
Now covered by the lawn.<br>
<br>
