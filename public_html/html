"Then he suddenly saw clearly that he was leading a strange life, that he was doing many things that were only a game, that he was quite cheerful and sometimes experienced pleasure, <b>but that real life was flowing past him and did not touch him.</b> Like a player who plays with his ball, he played with his business, with the people around him, watched them, derived amusement from them; but with his heart, with his real nature, he was not there. His real self wandered elsewhere, far away, wandered on and on invisibly and had nothing to do with his life. <b>He was sometimes afraid of these thoughts and wished that he could also share their childish daily affairs with intensity, truly to take part in them, to enjoy and live their lives instead of only being there as an onlooker."</b> 
<br>-From <i>Siddhartha; "Amongst the People"</i>
<br>
<br> This passage describes how Siddhartha's lifestyle is different from ordinary peoples'. He is not really living, but rather trying to go beyond living by reaching Nirvana. The result is lack of happiness; he thinks to much and tries too hard. He wishes that he could be an ordinary person, because then at least he could be happy and experience things like love. He later tells his friend Kamala, who has a similar problem to Siddhartha's, "Perhaps people like us cannot love. Ordinary people can-- that is their secret." (75)
